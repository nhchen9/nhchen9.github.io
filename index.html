        Hi, my name is <b>Nicholas Chen</b>.  
        I'm a machine learning researcher, currently a Master's student at Carnegie Mellon University.  
        My main interest is applying deep learning to finance and vision.  
        I hope to develop robust, explainable, and privacy-preserving models that expand the human capacity for achievement.

                Safer Illinois Virtual COVID-19 Status Cards
              </div>
              <p>
                Powerful analytics tools frequently require the collection of sensitive user information, 
                introducing a delicately balanced trade-off  between  data  driven  functionality  and  personal  privacy.  
                As  more  user  information  is  disclosed,  applications can provide more accurate, responsive, and personalized experiences;  
                yet  the  privacy  risk  increases  accordingly.

                <br>
                <br>

                My team is developing two secure, privacy-preserving computing systems to bridge this divide and facilitate safe reopening at the University of Illinois: Safer Illinois and RokWall.
                Safer Illinois, a decentralized app for bluetooth contact tracing and COVID-19 risk passports, has been deployed on campus since in August 2020 and has measured 50,000 unique users. 
                RokWall is an architecture built on secure hardware/software enclaves to support centralized analytics imperative for guiding public policy decisions.

                <br>
                <br>

                I am currently leading development of a COVID-19 Status Card application leveraging AWS Nitro enclaves.
                This project is particularly exciting because of its immediate practical value for the safe reopening of the UIUC campus community.
                More generally, I believe it suggests a generalizable framework for trustworthy, transparent, and scalable centralized computation which is not otherwise satisfied by pure hardware approaches.

                Super-Resolution Augmented Image Compression
              </div>
              <p>
                Image compression is ubiquitously applied in data storage and communication applications, where both file size and perceptual quality are imperative.
                To this end, prior works on learned compression have made tremendous progress in recent years.
                However, current deep learning-based image compression algorithms incur significant server-side compute cost, necessitating expensive inference for each pre-computed image and resolution pair, limiting practical usability at scale.

                <br>
                <br>

                To this end, instead of directly compressing the original image, our approach compresses an initially downscaled image, then flexibly resizes and enhances the image after transmission.
                By doing so, we achieve two significant, fundamental benefits over existing methods.
                First, an n&times; downsample operation results in n<sup>2</sup>&times; fewer pixels stored, thereby dramatically reducing storage and computational burden per image compression for the service provider.
                Second, super-resolution allows a recipient to flexibly resize an image to their device resolution, meaning that a service provider can compress and store only one image resolution server-side while still delivering any desired output image resolution to clients.

                Our results demonstrate 6.5&times; increased compression throughput, 60% reduced file storage size, and 19% higher perceptual image quality than current state-of-the-art algorithms at comparable bitrates.

    <p>Hi, my name is <b>Nicholas Chen</b>.  
      I'm an aspiring researcher in secure machine learning, currently an undergraduate at the University of Illinois.  
      My main interest is applying artificial intelligence to healthcare and finance.  
      I hope to develop robust, explainable, and privacy-preserving models that reliably solve important problems facing humanity. 
      I'm currently applying for graduate programs and generally open to interesting work!

                Safer Illinois Virtual COVID-19 Status Cards

              <p>
                Powerful analytics tools frequently require the collection of sensitive user information, 
                introducing a delicately balanced trade-off  between  data  driven  functionality  and  personal  privacy.  
                As  more  user  information  is  disclosed,  applications can provide more accurate, responsive, and personalized experiences;  
                yet  the  privacy  risk  increases  accordingly.

                <br>
                <br>

                My team is developing two secure, privacy-preserving computing systems to bridge this divide and facilitate safe reopening at the University of Illinois: Safer Illinois and RokWall.
                Safer Illinois, a decentralized app for bluetooth contact tracing and COVID-19 risk passports, has been deployed on campus since in August 2020 and has measured 50,000 unique users. 
                RokWall is an architecture built on secure hardware/software enclaves to support centralized analytics imperative for guiding public policy decisions.

                <br>
                
                I am currently leading development of a COVID-19 Status Card application leveraging AWS Nitro enclaves.  
                This project is particularly exciting because of its immediate practical value for the safe reopening of the UIUC campus community.
                More generally, I believe it suggests a generalizable framework for trustworthy, transparent, and auditable centralized computation in a scalable, performant, and intuitive manner which is not otherwise satisfied.

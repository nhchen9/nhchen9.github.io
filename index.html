    <p>Hi, my name is <b>Nicholas Chen</b>.  
      I'm an aspiring researcher in secure machine learning, currently an undergraduate at the University of Illinois.  
      <br>
      My main interests are artificial intelligence, finance, and security.
      I am applying for graduate programs and generally open to interesting work!

                Powerful analytics tools frequently require the collection of sensitive user information, 
                introducing a delicately balanced trade-off  between  data  driven  functionality  and  personal  privacy.  
                As  more  user  information  is  disclosed,  applications can provide more accurate, responsive, and personalized experiences;  
                yet  the  privacy  risk  increases  accordingly.

                <br>
                <br>

                My team is currently investigating how best to bridge this divide with trusted execution environments.
                We are currently developing a COVID-19 risk status computation system leveraging hardware/software enclaves to uphold 
                strong privacy and security guarantees for user medical data.
